# Chronos Timeline - a plugin for Obsidian

Chronos is a custom markdown syntax used for visualizing interactive timelines inline in your Obsidian notes. Timelines are styled to adapt to your Obsidian theme.

This plugin is powered by the [vis-timeline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vis-timeline) library.

## Basic usage

# Syntax Overview

Chronos parses markdown in `chronos` code blocks

````markdown
```chronos

<your chronos timeline items here>

```
````

## Dates

- lazy dates OK

## Item types

The first character of each line in your `chronos` block determines the item type. Certain can be modified with colors and group membership (see [Modifiers](#modifiers))

### Comments (`#`)

Chronos will ignore any line that starts with `#`. You can use this to write comments to yourself or block out items.

Example

```
# this line is a comment, it will be ignored by chronos

- [1789~1799] French Revolution
- [1791~1804] Haitian Revolution
- [1776] American Declaration of Independence

# the event below will not render, since it has been commented out
# - [1939~1945] World War II

```

### Events (`-`)

Events can include a single date or a date range.

#### Single Date Event

```

- [Date] Event Name | Description

```

- YYYY-MM-DD: The date of the event
- Event Name (optional): The name or title of the event (optional)
- Description (optional): Shows up in a tooltip when you hover on an event

Example

#### Date Range Event:

The date range is represented with a tilde (~) between the start and end dates.

```

- [Date~Date] Event Name | Description

```

Example

#### events with descriptions

You can add additional information to an event by adding a pipe `|` after the Event name. This text will appear when you hover on an event.

Example

### Periods (`@`)

Periods represent a span of time in which multiple events occur. Periods are shown with a background color and are represented using the @ symbol. Periods can cover a broad time frame.

```

@ [YYYY-MM-DD~YYYY-MM-DD] Period Name

```

    YYYY-MM-DD~YYYY-MM-DD: The start and end dates of the period.
    Period Name: The title or name of the period.

Periods allow you to group related events and give them context by highlighting the time frame.

### Markers (`=`)

Markers are used to highlight a significant event that defines the start or end of a time period. Markers are typically placed on key dates and represent important milestones.

```
= [YYYY-MM-DD] Marker Name
```

    YYYY-MM-DD: The specific date of the marker.
    Marker Name: The title or description of the marker.

```

In this example, periods are used to group events in distinct phases (e.g., "Early Cold War," "Height of Tensions"), events have specific dates or ranges (e.g., "Potsdam Conference" on 1945-07-17, "Berlin Blockade" from 1948-06-24 to 1949-05-12), and the end of a major period is highlighted with a marker (= [1991-12-26] End of the Cold War).
